That's why not the politicians should do it, but the people\" It should contain \"what we wanna the world to be in 20 years, in 40 years. How the future should be for all of us. And locally, as well.\"\nMost of the people don't know their constitution, because they didn't read it. \n\"I'm an plug-in for the public\", because of the information act. \"We can change things and have an impact.\"\n\"Living in a free democracy is work.\" People are forgetting this. We have a obligation to participate and form our society. \nLaws should be written understandble, they should be simple, because many people feel intimidated by laws.\nQ: How you involved people not tech savy in the process? A: People could meet officials or send email, to participate in the constitution-process. \n\n"}
