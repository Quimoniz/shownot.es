I talk especially to geek men. Being geek is about getting revenge. About being curious and clever, making things, fixing things and finding out how things work. When it comes to women than it is not like that.\n\n\nHow to make tech conferences more welcoming and safer for women? Start with realising that they are not a space of men that need to make women more welcome, but an equal space of men and women; plan and realise them together. Geek guys and geek girls should talk to each other about sexism and how to build a community. Transparency as answer. You need to habe men and women all along the way. If your tech conference is 90% dudes, your conference is rubbish. \n\nBangladesh guy (feminist) the gender dimension also damages men\nInternet as problem (not the only one) and as answer of sexism\n\n"}
